          <h3>Governing Law</h3>
          <p>These Terms and any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
          
          <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>Any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of its confidential information or proprietary rights.</p>
          
          <h3>Waiver of Class Actions</h3>
          <p>All claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims.</p>
          
          <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
          <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and CheckMet regarding the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations, written or oral, concerning their subject matter.</p>
          
          <h3>Severability</h3>
          <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. An invalid or unenforceable provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.</p>
          
          <h3>Assignment</h3>
          <p>You may not assign these Terms or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms or any of our rights or obligations under these Terms without your consent.</p>
          
          <h3>No Waiver</h3>
          <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of CheckMet.</p>
          
          <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
          <p>We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside our reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.</p>
