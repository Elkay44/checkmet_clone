          <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
          <p>We may share your information in the following situations:</p>
          
          <h3>With Your Employer</h3>
          <p>As the controller of your personal data, your employer has access to your attendance records and related information processed through our system.</p>
          
          <h3>Service Providers</h3>
          <p>We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, and contractors who perform services for us and need access to such information to do that work.</p>

        <div id="biometric-data" class="privacy-section">
          <h2>Special Provisions for Biometric Data</h2>
          <p>Given the sensitive nature of biometric data, we implement special provisions for its processing:</p>
          
          <h3>Explicit Consent</h3>
          <p>We require explicit consent from individuals before collecting and processing their biometric data. This consent is typically obtained by your employer during the enrollment process.</p>
          
          <h3>No Facial Image Storage</h3>
          <p>We do not store actual facial images. During enrollment, facial scans are immediately converted into encrypted mathematical templates that cannot be reverse-engineered into an actual image.</p>
          
          <h3>Limited Use</h3>
          <p>Biometric templates are used solely for the purpose of attendance verification and are not used for any other purpose without additional consent.</p>
          
          <h3>Enhanced Security</h3>
          <p>Biometric templates are protected with industry-leading encryption and security measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>
          
          <h3>Alternative Methods</h3>
          <p>We provide alternative non-biometric methods for attendance tracking for individuals who do not consent to facial recognition.</p>
